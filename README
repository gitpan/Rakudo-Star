NAME
    Rakudo::Star - install Rakudo Star from CPAN

SYNOPSIS
    This module is here as a version container - see Rakudo::Star::Paths for
    documentation of how to find the install.

DESCRIPTION
    Basically, this module convinces MakeMaker to build a bundled version of
    <http://rakudo.org>'s "Star" release, then provides a way to find it on
    disk.

    Note that since parrot is not relocatable, the rakudo install is not
    relocatable - so putting it in a local::lib dir and then "mv"-ing that
    directory is not going to work yet. Sorry.
