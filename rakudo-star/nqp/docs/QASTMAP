# QAST Roadmap

This is an overall list of things that need doing and problems that need
solving on the way to having a QAST-based NQP.

## NQP

NQP is currently somewhat half-Parroty, half-6modely. This causes various issues
that will need to be addresses for portability reasons, and moving NQP to QAST is
a good chance to do so.

### Integer/Float/String and the ops
Need to work out an approach to handling these.

### Native types
NQP should get natively typed lexicals and arguments.
