NAME

MIME::Base64 - Encoding and decoding Base64 ASCII strings. A Perl6 implementation of MIME::Base64

DESCRIPTION

A single module is available:

  MIME::Base64

    Implements encoding and decoding to and from base64 using an underlying
    parrot library. This is a relatively fast implementation.

STATUS

Version 1.1 and later works on latest Rakudo based on nom. For earlier
versions of Rakudo based on ng, please use v1.0 (see tag v1.0-ng).

A pure Perl 6 version of MIME::Base64 will be included when pack/unpack is
available in the Perl 6 core.
