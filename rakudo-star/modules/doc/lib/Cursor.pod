=TITLE class Cursor

    class Cursor { }

A C<Cursor> object is used interally by the regex engine in regex matches
to keep track of the current position, backtracking waypoints and information
about capturing groups.

A user-space program usually doesn't need to deal with C<Cursor> objects,
just with their relatives, L<Match> objects.
