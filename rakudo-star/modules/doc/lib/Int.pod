=TITLE class Int

    class Int is Cool does Real { ... }

C<Int> objects store integral numbers of arbitrary size. C<Int>s are immutable.

There are two main syntax forms for C<Int> literals

    123         # Int in decimal notation
    :16<BEEF>   # Int in radix notations

Both forms allow underscores between any two digits which can serve as visual
separators, but don't carry any meaning:

    5_00000     # five Lakhs
    500_000     # five hundred thousand
