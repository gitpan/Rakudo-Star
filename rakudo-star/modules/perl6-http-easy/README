HTTP::Easy
-----------

Perl 6 libraries to make HTTP servers easily. 

This was inspired by HTTP::Server::Simple, but has a very different internal
API, and extended functionality. It's been designed to work well with my
own WWW::App and SCGI libraries. Also see my HTTP::Client library if you
are looking for an HTTP client rather than an HTTP server.

= HTTP::Easy =

A role to build custom HTTP servers. 
Provides the framework for parsing HTTP connections.
The classes implementing this must provide the rest, and send the appropriate 
output (in HTTP compliant ways.)

= HTTP::Easy::PSGI =

A class implementing HTTP::Easy. This builds a PSGI environment, and passes 
it onto a handler. The handler must return a PSGI response 
(e.g.: [ $status, @headers, @body ] )

This can be used as an engine in the WWW::App library.

= HTTP::Easy::SCGI =

 ** Not implemented yet, see TODO **

A class implementing HTTP::Easy. This connects to an SCGI daemon. 
It will receive the reply from the SCGI daemon, and parse it accordingly 
(it automatically detects if NPH output was returned.)

= Examples =

See the examples in the 'examples/' folder.

= Requirements =

 * Rakudo Perl 6
 * HTTP::Status
