Deprecations in 2012.08

    Parameters preceeded by a | or \ may not have a sigil anymore.
        sub f(\$x) { say $x }
    must be changed to 
        sub f(\x) { say x }
    Usage of \$x will unconditionally warn in 2012.09 and be removed in 2012.10

    IO::Path.dir (which returns the directory part of the path)
    has been renamed to IO::Path.directory.
    IO::Path.dir will be removed or re-purposed in 2012.09

    The LAZY statement prefix will be removed in 2012.09. It was a non-specced
    experiment and did not work out well.
