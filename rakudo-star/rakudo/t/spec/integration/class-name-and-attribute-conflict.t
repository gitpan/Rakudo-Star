The parser won't do right thing when two(or more) class-es get
attributes whose name are the same.

hmm, It's conflicted with class name and attribute name.

***** These two examples below will fail to parse. *****

##### this example below will cause pugs hang.
class a {has $.a; method update { $.a; } }; class b { has $.a; submethod BUILD { a.new( a => $.a ).update; } };class c { has $.b; submethod BUILD { b.new( a => $.b ); } };c.new( b => 30 );

##### this example will say sub isn't found.
class a { has $.a; method update { $.a; } };class b { has $.a; submethod BUILD { a.new( a => $.a ).update; }; }; b.new( a => 20 );

Problems with this test:
* The classes "a", "b", and "c" are redefined several times.
  { class Foo {...} }; say Foo.new;
  # works, even though Foo was declared in a different lexical scope
  Proposal: Change the class names to "a1", "b1", "a2", "b2", etc.

* This also causes some infloops, as some classes' BUILD call itself
  (indirectly) (this is a consequence of the first problem).

* *Most importantly*: Because the classes are redefined -- especially because
  .update is redefined -- only the $var of subtest #3 gets updated, *not* the
  $var of subtest #1 or #2!

  { my $var; class Foo { method update { $var = 42 }; Foo.new.update; say $var }
  { my $var; class Foo { method update { $var = 42 } }
  # This will output "" instead of "42", as the $var of the second scope is
  # changed, not the $var of the first line.
  # &Foo::update changes the $var of its scope. This $var is not the $var of
  # the first line.

  I see to solutions to this problem:

  * Write "my class" instead of "class" -- but lexical classes are not yet
    implemented.
  * Change the class names -- there may only be one class "a", one class "b",
    etc. in the file. (Note again that {} scopes don't have an effect on global
    (OUR::) classes).

  [A similar example:
    { my $var; sub update { $var = 42 }; update(); say $var }
    { my $var; sub update { $var = 42 } }
    # This outputs "".

    { my $var; my sub update { $var = 42 }; update(); say $var }
    { my $var; my sub update { $var = 42 } }
    # This outputs "42".]

* The last subtest calls c.new(...).update, but there is no &c::update and c
  doesn't inherit from a class providing an "update" method, either.
