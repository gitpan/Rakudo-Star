    # P28 (**) Sorting a list of lists according to length of sublists
    # 
    # a) We suppose that a list contains elements that are lists themselves. The
    # objective is to sort the elements of this list according to their length. E.g.
    # short lists first, longer lists later, or vice versa.
    # 
    # Example:
    # * (lsort '((a b c) (d e) (f g h) (d e) (i j k l) (m n) (o)))
    # ((O) (D E) (D E) (M N) (A B C) (F G H) (I J K L))
    # 
    # b) Again, we suppose that a list contains elements that are lists themselves.
    # But this time the objective is to sort the elements of this list according to
    # their length frequency; i.e., in the default, where sorting is done
    # ascendingly, lists with rare lengths are placed first, others with a more
    # frequent length come later.
    # 
    # Example:
    # * (lfsort '((a b c) (d e) (f g h) (d e) (i j k l) (m n) (o)))
    # ((i j k l) (o) (a b c) (f g h) (d e) (d e) (m n))
    # 
    # Note that in the above example, the first two lists in the result have length 4
    # and 1, both lengths appear just once. The third and forth list have length 3
    # which appears twice (there are two list of this length). And finally, the last
    # three lists have length 2. This is the most frequent length.
