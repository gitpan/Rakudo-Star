    # P41 (**) A list of Goldbach compositions.

    # Given a range of integers by its lower and upper limit, print a list
    # of all even numbers and their Goldbach composition.
    #
    # Example:
    # * (goldbach-list 9 20)
    # 10 = 3 + 7
    # 12 = 5 + 7
    # 14 = 3 + 11

    # numbers, one of them is very small. Very rarely, the primes are both 
    # bigger than say 50. Try to find out how many such cases there are in
    # the range 2..3000.

    # Example (for a print limit of 50):
    # * (goldbach-list 1 2000 50)
    # 992 = 73 + 919
    # 1382 = 61 + 1321
    # 1856 = 67 + 1789

    # fr(S,F) terms. 
    # Example: [fr(a,45),fr(b,13),fr(c,12),fr(d,16),fr(e,9),fr(f,5)].

    # hc(e,'1101'), hc(f,'1100')] [hc(a,'01'),...etc.]. The task shall be

    # (a (b (d nil nil) (e nil nil)) (c nil (f (g nil nil) nil)))
    # 
    # Other examples are a binary tree that consists of a root node only:
    #
