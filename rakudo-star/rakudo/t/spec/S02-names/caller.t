Larry ruled that as erroneous.

15:13 < iblech> autrijus: :) BTW, WRT lex hoisting: sub foo { $CALLER::a }; { foo(); my $a
= 3; foo() }
15:13 < autrijus> iblech: larry ruled it as erroneous.
15:13 < autrijus> i.e. foo()'s behaviour is undefined.
15:14 < iblech> ok then :)
15:14 < autrijus> it's essential we do that because
15:14 < autrijus> foo($a, my $a)
15:14 < autrijus> is legal
15:14 < autrijus> and will be simply hazadrous to implement either way.
